                    <p id="highschool"><strong>Thompson High School</strong>: I went to highschool at Thompson High School in Alabaster, AL, where I was the captain of the tennis team as well as a member of the National Honor Society, Spanish Honor Society, and the Math Honor Society. I was also the student council vice president and was the salutatorian of my graduating class in 2013.</p>
                    <p id="JSU"><strong>Jacksonville State University</strong>: I attended JSU, in Jacksonville, AL, from 2013 to 2015. Before transferring, I was a student government representative and was on the Dean's list my freshman year.</p>
                    <p id="UAB"><strong>Unversity of Alabama at Birmingham</strong>: I attend UAB, in Birmingham, AL, from 2015 until I graduated in 2019. I transferred to UAB to be study business while working to forward my career at Publix.

                    <p id="dogs"><strong>My dogs</strong>: I have two dogs, Hank (7) and Betty (3). They truly are man's best friend and as strange as it is I feel like we often watch out for each other. I take care of them in all of the obvious ways, but they seem to know when I need to be distracted or when I need to make myself take a break and just go for a walk. I remember getting Hank for the <a href="https://gbhs.org/adoptable-pets" title="link to the greater birmingham human society" id="gbhs" target="_blank">Greater Birmingham Human Society</a> and we've been inseperable ever since.</p>
                    <p id="dnd"><strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong>: DND is one of my favorite ways to relax and socialize. My favorite classes are paladin and rogue, though combining the two never seems to work. I am currently DM'ing two games, <em>Call of the Netherdeep</em>and <em>Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus.</em> I feel like DM'ing DND games helps develop my creativity and improv skills, but ultimately I do play it because it's fun.</p>
                    <p id="football"><strong>Football</strong>: My favorite season is football season. Growing up in Alabama, there's a choice every person must make. How to answer the question "Who ya for?" and there is only one answer, The University of Alabama Crimson Tide. I am also a fan of the Miami Dolphins and the Cleveland Browns.</p>
